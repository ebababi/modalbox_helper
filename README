= ModalboxHelper

Modalbox Helper plugin is an ActionView helper that facilitates the use of the
ModalBox javascript library, which in turn manages javascript pop-ups for the
browser, based on Prototype and script.aculo.us frameworks.

== Installation

After installing the plugin on the rails enviroment it is required for the
helper's static files to be copied in the public location, for the helper to be
activated in the application controller and for the application layout to
include the CSS files. A generator have been created for those tasks:

    $ rails generate modalbox_helper

Nevertheless, it is still required to update the application layout:

    <%= stylesheet_link_tag 'modalbox_helper' %>
    <%= javascript_include_tag 'modalbox_helper' %>

== Usage

Modal dialogs links are created through the use of the <tt>link_to_modal</tt>
method. This method behaves exactly as the <tt>link_to</tt> method, but the
destination content is loaded on a modal box.

=== Examples

This creates a modal dialog for the content of a url:

  <%= link_to_modal 'Preferences', edit_user_registration_path %>
